Knightvania is a game that I made for the 365 Indies game jam 2016. I made the game in one week, and the theme was "It shouldn't be here", and I used it in the history of the game. A strange object what brought from a different dimension, and this is causing some colateral effects in all the multiverse.

You play as a knight that come from other dimension too, but you was brought to discover the problem and try to solve it.

The game is a classical metroidvania, so you need to explore the map and find new abilities to keep progressing.
