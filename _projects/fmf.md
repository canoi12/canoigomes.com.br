Forgive Me Father is **a dark retro horror FPS set in a comic book style world inspired by the novels of H.P.** **Lovecraft**. As the only one left with full senses, you begin a journey in search of answers and relief.

In FMF I worked as a Game Porting Engineer, porting the game to the platforms `Xbox One`, `PS4` and `Nintendo Switch`.
