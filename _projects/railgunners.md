Railgunners is a shooter built to highly customizable difficulty levels. Fight your way through hundreds of enemy ships, and help humanity fight back against the alien invasion!

I participated in the initial game design and programming, but I don't stayed in the development until the end. The game initially raised as a idea for a ludum dare, where the idea was to mix two genres of games, so me and my friend Filipe (responsible for all the art of Railgunners) decided to make a game mixing a shmup game with a runner. So your ship is launched from a cannon and fly until it reaches its limits.
